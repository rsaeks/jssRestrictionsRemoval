#  Use

The simplest request with Just looks like this:

```swift
//  A simple get request
Just.get("http://httpbib.org/get")
```

The next example shows how to upload a file along with some data:

```swift
//  talk to registration end point
let r = Just.post(
    "http://justiceleauge.org/member/register",
    data: ["username": "barryallen", "password":"ReverseF1ashSucks"],
    files: ["profile_photo": .URL(fileURLWithPath:"flash.jpeg", nil)]
)

if (r.ok) { /* success! */ }
```

Here's the same example done asyncronously:

```swift
//  talk to registration end point
Just.post(
    "http://justiceleauge.org/member/register",
    data: ["username": "barryallen", "password":"ReverseF1ashSucks"],
    files: ["profile_photo": .URL(fileURLWithPath:"flash.jpeg", nil)]
) { (r)
    if (r.ok) { /* success! */ }
}

```

#  Install

Here are some ways to leverage Just.

## Carthage (recommended)

Include the following in your Cartfile:

    github "JustHTTP/Just"

Just includes dynamic framework targets for both iOS and OS X.

## Cocoapods

The usual way:

    platform :ios, '8.0'
    use_frameworks!

    target 'MyApp' do
      pod 'Just'
    end

## Manual

Drop `Just.xcodeproj` into your project navigator. Under the *General* tab of
your project settings, use the plus sign to add `Just.framework` to
*Linked Framework and Libraries*. Make sure to include the correct version
for your target's platform.

It's also common to add Just as a git submodule to your projects repository:

    cd path/to/your/project
    git submodule add https://github.org/JustHTTP/Just.git


## Source File

Put `Just.swift` directly into your project. Alternately, put it in the
*Sources* folder of a playground. (The latter makes a fun way to explore the
web.)

#  Contribute

Pull requests are welcome. Here are some tips for code contributors:

Work in `Just.xcworkspace`.

Tests requires [Quick][], which is a submodule to this repository. Make sure
you run the following before attempting to test:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

For Xcode rebels, checkout `Makefile` (you'll need [xcpretty][]).

HTML documentation pages are generated by literate programmin tool [docco][]
